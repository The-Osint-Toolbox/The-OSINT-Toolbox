This is work in progress, you will discover links to useful, OSINT, Privacy & OPSEC resources, tradecraft, tools, techniques & tactics. Please feel free to explore. 
<br></br>
The nature of OSINT and to some extent Privacy, means resources come and go, and occasionally  some links maybe broken. Feel free to DM me on Twitter if you find any broken links.
<br></br>
The links to other websites, blogs, resources & tools etc, contained within. do not represent any kind of recommendation or endorsement and I have absolutely no commercial links or affiliation to them.
<br></br>
I encourage you to understnad any resources or tools you use, as I provide links and not tutorials. Remember your own OPSEC too.
