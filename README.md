This is work in progress but eventually you will discover links to useful, OSINT, Privacy & OPSEC resources, tools, techniques & tactics. Please free to explore in the meantiime. 
The nature of OSINT and to some extend Privacy resources come and go, and occasionally  some links maybe broken. Feel free to DM me Twitter if you find any broken links.

The links to other websites, blogs, resources & tools etc, contained within this website do not represent any kind of recommendation or endorsement and I have absolutely no commercial links or affiliation to them.
